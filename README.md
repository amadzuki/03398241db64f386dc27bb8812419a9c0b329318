## Kulina Front-End Preliminary Test

> A part of mobile view page based on designs using ReactJS

## Summary

The project is bootstrapped with create-react-app. All the stylings is done by `xstyled`, a wrapper for `styled-components`, but with more features. I utilize `theming` color styles of the project with xstyled theme feature so the design is consistent. Although the design is only for mobile view, specifically for iPhone X (screen width: 370px); it can also be responsive in some degree because I used flexbox. I mostly use arrow function to create components and I made sure to do type checking with `PropTypes` for components that use props. I create dummy data and put it in JSON file for this project. I manage data between components with `useState` by sending setter and getter function through props. Lastly, I deploy it via github pages with repo name which is a hash of my github username that generated from sha-1 online generator.
